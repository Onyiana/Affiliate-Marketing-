                            need a warehouse or a logistics system to sell your wares.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            One of the quickest ways to get started selling online is to leverage the power of third-party sites. E-commerce giants like Amazon, 
                            eBay, Etsy, and Craigslist are powerful sales and marketing platforms with a built-in prospect base. Millions of people regularly 
                            shop on these sites, and the numbers keep growing. 
                        </p>

                            sellers on their website, representing 40 percent of all sales. Another benefit of using Amazon (as well as these other third-party sites) 
                            is that people already trust them and are more likely to buy off of them then from your own independant website if you had one

                            These three steps allow you to piggyback on eBay's reputation, reach, and sales and marketing infrastructure in order to sell your own products. 
                            Though you can list a single price on eBay the big benefit of their platform is the auction system which let's your prospective buyers get into bidding wars 
                            - driving up the price you can sell at with the items you are listing.

                        </p>

                            <span style="font-weight: 600;">Craigslist:</span> Perhaps one of the oldest sites when it comes to listing items for sale this is still a great place to list and sell items.

                            E-books represent about 20 percent of all book sales in the U.S. The good news is you don't have to be a publisher with deep pockets to 
                            get in on the action. As a solo internet entrepreneur, you can sell ebooks directly from your own website. You can sell your own works or sell a public domain work.
