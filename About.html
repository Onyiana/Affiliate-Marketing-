                        Many have different perspective about affiliate marketing and explains it base on what they understand 
                        but the fact still remain "Affiliate Marketing is not a referral business".Affiliate marketing can help you 
                        earn thousands of dollars a month by recommending genuine products and services that can actually benefit your audience.

                        Affiliate marketing is an advertising model (that is, it deals with salling of a product which will be offered to you during your registration.) 
                        in which a company compensates third-party publishers to generate traffic or leads to the company's 
                        products and services. The third-party publishers are affiliates, and the commission fee incentivizes them to find ways to promote the company.

                        <h3>How Do Affiliate Marketers Get Paid?</h3>
                        <p>
                            1. Affiliate marketers get paid a commission for directly or indirectly referring customers to 
                            companies where they purchases a product like E-books.These commissions can range from less than 1% to 20% or more, 
                            depending on the product being purchased and level of referral volume.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            2. An affiliate marketer is paid in different ways:Pay per click for redirecting the customers from your blog or marketing channel to the seller's 
                            website where the product is listed originally. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            3. You get paid per sale to get a theirbby geting percentage of the product's per sale price.
                            For online campaigns, a customized link or referral code is used to track sales. In this sense, 
                            it is a source or passive income since the affiliate can continue to earn money once they have set up their campaign.
