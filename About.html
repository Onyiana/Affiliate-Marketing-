                    <p> 
                        Many have different perspective about affiliate marketing and explains it base on what they understand 
                        but the fact still remain "Affiliate Marketing is not a referral business".Affiliate marketing can help you 
                        earn thousands of dollars a month by recommending genuine products and services that can actually benefit your audience.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Affiliate marketing is an advertising model (that is, it deals with salling of a product which will be offered to you during your registration.) 
                        in which a company compensates third-party publishers to generate traffic or leads to the company's 
                        products and services. The third-party publishers are affiliates, and the commission fee incentivizes them to find ways to promote the company.

                        <h3>How Do Affiliate Marketers Get Paid?</h3>
                        <p>
                            1. Affiliate marketers get paid a commission for directly or indirectly referring customers to 
                            companies where they purchases a product like E-books.These commissions can range from less than 1% to 20% or more, 
                            depending on the product being purchased and level of referral volume.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            2. An affiliate marketer is paid in different ways:Pay per click for redirecting the customers from your blog or marketing channel to the seller's 
                            website where the product is listed originally. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            3. You get paid per sale to get a theirbby geting percentage of the product's per sale price.
                            For online campaigns, a customized link or referral code is used to track sales. In this sense, 
                            it is a source or passive income since the affiliate can continue to earn money once they have set up their campaign.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Affiliate Marketer</h3>
                        <p>
                            An affiliate marketer promotes the seller's services or products on their platform or site by persuading the audience. 
                            They can do this by creating compelling content around the product or service, explaining its benefits.
